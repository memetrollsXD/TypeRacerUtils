# Features

## Disable Save and Print shortcuts like CTRL + S and CTRL + P 

<p>This feature is very useful if your average accuracy isn't that high and the "Save File" dialog makes you lose a lot of WPM</p>

## One Backspace 

<p>You can delete the whole input box with only 1 backspace press, so no more backspace spamming.</p>
---
## Disable Caps Lock 

<p>You can disable caps lock easily with this app</p>
