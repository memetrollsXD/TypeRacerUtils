# Features

<h2>Disable Save and Print shortcuts like CTRL + S and CTRL + P</h2>

<p>This feature is very useful if your average accuracy isn't that high and the "Save File" dialog makes you lose a lot of WPM</p><br>

<h2>One Backspace</h2>

<p>You can delete the whole input box with only 1 backspace press, so no more backspace spamming.</p><br>
<hr>
<h2>Disable Caps Lock</h2> 

<p>You can disable caps lock easily with this app</p><br>
